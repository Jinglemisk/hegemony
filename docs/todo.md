## ⭐ Final quality passes — DO AT THE VERY END OF THE WHOLE PHASES RUN (owner, 2026-07-18)

These are deliberately deferred to a polish sweep once all phases have shipped — do
NOT do them mid-run. Revisit each with a fresh balance eye + a human playtest read:

- **Buildings pass** — revisit the whole roster, especially **Villa** (+2 tile
  material/level — sim-tuned, greedy bots under-build it) and **Gymnasion** (−2 promote
  cost — greedy bots never exercise it). Re-check every building's cost, effect size, and
  `maxLevel` cap once the full system (assembly, luxuries, ideas — whatever ships) is in
  and there's a smarter bot or human data. Prices were set for the mid-game in isolation.
- **Market / bank pass** — revisit the bank exchange as a whole: the per-material
  scarcity classes (stone drifted scarce→baseline in Phase 2), the sell/buy spreads, the
  `uniform` vs `scarcity` derivation knob, and the bankBuy churn the greedy bots show
  (~190/game — likely a bot artifact, but confirm it isn't a real exploit). The rates
  have been "PROVISIONAL" since Phase 1; this is where they get finalized. Also fold in:
  the venture wood-stake is strictly cheaper than the gold stake at bank prices, and
  NEITHER sim bot upgrades colony→city (the whole colony→city path is dead) — check
  colony/upgrade pricing here.

## Gameplay & mechanics

- Follow the roadmap (docs/roadmap.md) and drive work through its Q&A workbench (docs/roadmap-appendix.md).
-- Phases 0–5 with exit gates; the appendix holds per-phase questions, the decision log, and the execution log. Start each session there.

- Keep the balance ledger current (docs/balance.html).
-- Living balance document: outstanding issues (ranked P0–P2), deck/economy analysis, playtest scenarios. Update it in the same commit as any change to ruleset.ts, data.ts, or the event decks; log the change in its changelog.

- Generalize effect resolution — ONE uniform pipeline for card/resolution effects. (user, 2026-07-23)
-- Any effect from any source (event card, assembly resolution, riot, ...) that says "lose 1 pop" /
   "gain X" must open the SAME designated modal for that effect kind — e.g. a "pop gain/loss" modal,
   distinct from the pop-migration and pop-promotion (mobility) modals — never a per-source one-off.
   Consistency is the point.
-- Temporary player-specific buffs/debuffs (for that season / that year / a resolution's duration)
   that touch income or expenditure must surface in THAT player's income display. Top level stays
   compact (e.g. "city → +1; city → −4" rather than every line item), but the drill-down — hover a
   city card in the ledger, hover a resource — must name the source: "+/− due to card X" or "due to
   resolution Y". Today that level shows the number but not WHERE it comes from.
-- Engine half already exists (`incomeModifier` with season/turn durations, `timedHappinessDelta`,
   and `calculateIncomeBreakdown` carries a `source` string per line); the uniform modal routing and
   the provenance drill-down UI do not. With assembly Laws live, both matter more now.

- Assembly 3-B is BUILT (spec + build record: docs/feat/assembly-politicians.md) — STILL OWED:
-- the hand-playtest, then the tuning numbers (`?tune` + sim), then the influence-aware bot voting
   (Phase 3-C — the `--policy smart` follow-up waits until the Assembly is playtested).

- Victory race minimums are ruleset tunables — the tuning sim campaign is still owed
  (cities min 3→2 verdict pending; see roadmap-appendix).

- Yearly omen (d6, shipped 2026-07-13) is PROVISIONAL — numbers await the user's eyes. The bigger
  yearly/omen d20 table idea stays in the design queue and lands on the shared event-table component.

- Seasonal mechanics — still open: an end-of-season resolution step (where happiness bites).

- Unrest — still open: Luxury Goods relief (needs coasts); the rulebook's exact −2/−4/−6 → 1/2/3
  food-unrest magnitudes. No passive drift (deliberate).

- Buildings — still candidates: Barracks (military placeholder — waits for a military design);
  PDF's Library/Embassy/Luxury Trader wait on National Ideas / Assembly / luxuries.

- Terrain follow-ups (pinned in docs/feat/terrain-economy.md): the **constrained shuffle**
  (landmarks never adjacent / not clustered / breadbasket off-rim — the classic board is authored
  fair by hand for now); **trade-before-stone-sinks** sequencing for the civic tier.
-- Watch (2026-07-18): greedy bots under-build Villa (they value banked wood/stone only at
   material/10) and never touch the Gymnasion (they barely promote) — both need a human or
   smarter-bot read. Seat spread P1 35% / P3 17% over 60 games (small sample).

- More start setups / game modes.
-- The mode seam already works (standard / fast-start / deathmatch), selected in code by
   GAME_CONFIG.mode — a mode is just a ruleset patch. Add more modes as data; an in-game mode
   picker is lobby scope (deferred).

- Luxury goods and trade.
-- Deferred design; see docs/feat/luxury-goods.md — amended by docs/feat/terrain-economy.md
   (distinct goods, diminishing duplicates, ~3 active per player cap).

- National ideas / player identities.
-- Per-player modifiers so the four seats play asymmetrically.
-- They pick these after initial colony placement to further bolster their playstyle.

- Coastal tiles and ports.
-- The map is inland-only right now — no coast, ports, or naval movement.

---

## Presentation & UI

- Two-panel remainders (docs/feat/two-panel.md) — now UNBLOCKED by 3-B:
-- **Player dossier:** click a roster player → the right panel shows their cities/pops/buildings —
   the same ledger tabs aimed elsewhere via an explicit `ownerId` + read-only flag (reuse, never
   fork — forks drift).
-- **Deep-link finer targets:** a specific building/entry, not just the chapter (needs concept-ids).
   These double as the codex-rulebook deep-link destinations (docs/feat/codex-rules.md piece 4).
-- **Per-panel back-stack:** pages become `{view, entry, scroll}` with a history stack; add it when
   deep-links create a second level.
-- **Responsive:** per-element minimums pass; sweep the stale docked-layout `responsive.css`
   breakpoints.

- Codex rulebook follow-up: generate rules.md from the same ruleset/content source so the in-game
  rulebook and the repo player guide can never drift.

- Optional: regenerate the autumn season icon to kill its faint cutout haze (only visible at
  large zoom).

## Tooling & testing

- Bot next lever: co-tune `evaluateSmart` weights via `--tune-patch` — the beam-vs-baselines run
  (docs/sim/2026-07-19-beam-vs-baselines.md) showed beam beats one-ply smart but LOSES to greedy
  because the smart EVAL over-promotes into unrest and the beam amplifies it. **The bottleneck is
  the evaluation, not the search.**
-- If large tuning campaigns need beam faster: commit-sequence memoization (provably identical
   output) or tune W/D.

---

## Tech debt & polish

- Shrink the .git history (~129 MB).
-- Bloated by old/replaced binary art still living in past commits.
-- Use git-filter-repo to purge the large blobs; coordinate first (rewrites history → force-push + everyone re-clones).

- Fix the 2 npm-audit vulnerabilities from the toolchain.

- Turn on stricter TypeScript flags.
-- noUncheckedIndexedAccess, noUnusedLocals, and friends.

- Split Resources into spendable goods vs. score meters.
-- Happiness and influence are meters, not spendable stock, but they currently ride in the same resource bag as wood/stone/gold/food.
